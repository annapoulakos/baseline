# Baseline Angular Development Stack

I needed to get a basic development stack up and running at work, so I created this setup.

It uses a number of packages:

* Angular, Angular Mocks
* Browserify
* Babel
* Karma
* PhantomJS
* Jasmine

## Installation

1. Clone this repo into the directory of choice.
2. `npm install`
3. Code

## Running tasks

In order to run the main browserify task: `gulp`
In order to run tests: `gulp karma`
